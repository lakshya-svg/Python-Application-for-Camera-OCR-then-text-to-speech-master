# Python-Application-for-Camera-OCR-then-text-to-speech-master
Built a beginner-level AI application that uses a camera to capture images, applies OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text, and converts it into speech output using a text-to-speech engine. This project demonstrates the integration of computer vision + NLP basics for real-world accessibility use cases.
