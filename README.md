## 🔹 Python Application for Camera OCR + Text-to-Speech  

This is a **beginner-friendly AI project** that combines **Computer Vision** and **Text-to-Speech** technologies to make a simple but practical application.  

### 📌 What This Project Does  
- 📸 **Capture Image from Camera:** Takes a live image input using the device camera.  
- 🧾 **Apply OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** Extracts any text from the captured image using libraries like `pytesseract`.  
- 🔊 **Convert Text to Speech:** Uses a text-to-speech engine (such as `pyttsx3` or `gTTS`) to read the detected text aloud.  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** – Main programming language  
- **OpenCV** – For camera input and image processing  
- **Pytesseract** – For text extraction (OCR)  
- **pyttsx3 / gTTS** – For converting text to speech  

### 🎯 Why This Project is Useful  
- Helps visually impaired users listen to text captured from physical documents.  
- Demonstrates the combination of **computer vision + NLP basics** in a simple, easy-to-understand way.  
- Great starting point for anyone interested in **AI, accessibility apps, and automation**.  

### 🚀 Future Improvements  
- Add support for multiple languages.  
- Improve text detection accuracy with deep learning-based OCR models.  
- Create a GUI interface for better user experience.
